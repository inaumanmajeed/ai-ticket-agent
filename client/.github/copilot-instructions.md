This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript frontend for an AI Ticket Assistant. The frontend should:

- Provide a form to submit support tickets
- Display ticket summary, category, suggested response, confidence, and optional trace/debug output
- Connect to a backend API for ticket processing

Follow best practices for React and Vite. Use modern, clean UI components.
